# Operators in python 

# arithmatic operator 
a = 5
b = 3
c=a+b
# print(f'the addition of a and b = {c}')

# print("The Addition of a and b =",c)


# Addition
# print("Addition:", a + b)  

# # Subtraction
# print("Subtraction:", a - b) 

# # Multiplication
# print("Multiplication:", a * b)  

# # Division
# print("Division:", a / b) 

# # Floor Division
# print("Floor Division:", a // b)  

# # Modulus
# print("Modulus:", a % b) 

# # Exponentiation
# print("Exponentiation:", a ** b) 


# Comparison of Python Operators

# a = 13
# b = 33

# print(a > b)
# print(a < b)
# print(a == b)
# print(a != b)
# print(a >= b)
# print(a <= b)


# Logical Operators in Python
# a = True 
# b = False
# print(a and b)  
# print(a or b)
# print(not a)


# Bitwise Operators in Python

# Bitwise NOT
# Bitwise Shift
# Bitwise AND
# Bitwise XOR
# Bitwise OR

# a = 10
# b = 4

# print(a & b)
# print(a | b)
# print(~a)
# print(a ^ b)
# print(a >> 2)
# print(a << 2)



# Assignment Operators in Python

# a = 10
# b = a
# print(b)
# b += a
# print(b)
# b -= a
# print(b)
# b *= a
# print(b)
# b <<= a
# print(b)


# Identity Operators in Python
# is          True if the operands are identical 
# is not      True if the operands are not identical 

# a = 10
# b = 20
# c = a

# print(a is not b)
# print(a is c)

# Membership Operators in Python

# in            True if value is found in the sequence
# not in        True if value is not found in the sequence

# x = 24
# y = 20
# list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# if (x not in list):
#     print("x is NOT present in given list")
# else:
#     print("x is present in given list")

# if (y in list):
#     print("y is present in given list")
# else:
#     print("y is NOT present in given list")
